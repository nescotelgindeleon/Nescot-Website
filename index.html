                    Our safe campus is set in the beautiful Surrey countryside and we are only 30 minutes away from central London with direct trains from Victoria and Waterloo. The large, free car park makes access easy for learners from throughout the region. We’ve invested £50 million into our campus to give you some of the best facilities there are.<br><br>

                    We work closely with employers to design our curriculum, and we plan assignments around what you’ll be doing in industry. We will expect you to work hard and push yourself, and we’ll be there to help you every step of the way.

                        As a student here, you are our top priority from the first time we meet you. Our team will ensure you have the best advice and guidance when you apply, the best possible education and training while you are here, and leave with the qualifications and skills to achieve your ambitions. Outside of the classroom, our dedicated and passionate team of support staff will help you to enjoy your time here, providing a range of services and out-of-class activities to ensure you get the most from the time you spend with us.<br><br>
                        I am very proud to say that we were designated as a ‘Good’ college by Ofsted at an inspection in January 2023. The inspection reflected our aim – that if you choose Nescot, you will benefit from a being part of a college that supports and motivates its students towards success.<br><br>
                        Nescot has been serving the community for 70 years now, and we have so much to offer at our beautiful campus in Ewell. As well as a wide range of course choices for school leavers and adults, we can offer a gym and sports facilities, professional salon, Starbucks cafe, a large car park and an on-site nursery. Our students can also benefit from a wide range of free online courses to broaden your learning experience. So, whether you are looking to study full-time, part-time or at university-level, I do hope you will choose to join us.<br><br>
